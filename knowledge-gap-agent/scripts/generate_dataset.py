"""Deterministically generate the synthetic tickets and KB articles for the Knowledge Gap Agent.

Run: python scripts/generate_dataset.py
Writes: data/tickets.json, data/kb_articles.json

The dataset is designed so that, after embedding-based clustering, several
recurring documentation themes should be classified as:
  - "good"    coverage (a detailed, matching KB article exists)
  - "weak"    coverage (an article exists but is generic/outdated)
  - "missing" coverage (no relevant article exists)

A separate set of "bug" tickets is included to verify the agent correctly
excludes product defects from documentation-gap analysis, even when they
recur frequently.

The `topic` field on each ticket is metadata for dataset design and test
evaluation only. It is never passed to the embedding model; clustering must
work from ticket subject/body text alone.
